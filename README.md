Hi I'm Tristan 👋

I am a software developer mainly working in JavaScript.  I'd like to learn Ruby on Rails and then dive into infosec, but for now I am looking to start my career in web development.

- 🍁 Check out my [portfolio](https://www.tristanrhodes.dev)
- 🌱 I’m currently building an application that visualizes common sorting algorithms.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I spent four months living in the Peruvian Amazon categorizing mushroom species.
