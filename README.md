Hi I'm Tristan ðŸ‘‹

I am a primarily front-end software developer experienced with JS, React, HTML, CSS and MongoDB/SQLite.  I have lesser experience with Python, C and Node.js/Express.

- ðŸ”­ You can find my projects on my [portfolio](https://rhodesrt.github.io/portfolio)
- ðŸŒ‡ I'm current seeking full-time employment as a front-end developer
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Node.js/Express
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I spent four months in the Peruvian Amazon categorizing mushroom species.
